# Live Coding Session on the SOLID Priciples to practice Open and Close Principle Key Takeaways through application

## Wrapping up Open Closed pricinple: 

"Software components should be closed for modification, but open for extension" 

- Open for extension means a software compentent should be able to add an extension of a new feature or behavior

- re-designed code made it follow OCP 
- Following OCP can lead to cost benefits in the long run 
- OCP and SRP can work together to achieve a better design 
- Do not apply OCP blindly and introduce unwanted complexity to your code.
