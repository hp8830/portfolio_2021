# Liskov Substitution Principle 

" Objects should be replaceable with their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program" 

### The "Is-A" way of thinking 

Hatchback --- "Is-A" ---> Car Class

Ostrictch --- "Is-A" ---> Bird Class

Premium Gasoline --- "Is-A" ---> Fuel Class


There are hidden problems with this approach. 
The ostrich has a different problems. 


So the Ostrich is-a bird, however the ostrich cannot fly 

So we would have a bird class with a fly method and one without a fly method 


Move away from the "Is-A" Principle 

"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck but it needs batteries, you probably have the wrong abstraction!"
