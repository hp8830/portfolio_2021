Key takeaways

1. A class is an idea (more or less abstract) which can be used to create a number of incarnations â€“ such an incarnation is called an object.


2. When a class is derived from another class, their relation is named inheritance. The class which derives from the other class is named a subclass. The second side of this relation is named superclass. A way to present such a relation is an inheritance diagram, where:

superclasses are always presented above their subclasses;
relations between classes are shown as arrows directed from the subclass toward its superclass.

3. Objects are equipped with:

a name which identifies them and allows us to distinguish between them;
a set of properties (the set can be empty)
a set of methods (can be empty, too)"""
